# Research: Full application localization (English, Arabic RTL, Simplified Chinese)

## Decisions
- Key Naming Convention: `section.component.identifier` (dot-delimited) – rationale: consistent with existing demo and improves grouping in IDE.
- Catalog Organization: Single JSON per locale (retain current structure) – minimizes loader complexity.
- Fallback Policy: Runtime fallback permitted only as safety; release gate enforces zero missing keys via CI script (to be implemented in tasks phase).
- RTL Strategy: Use CSS logical properties (margin-inline, padding-inline, text-align start/end) and `dir="rtl"` on <html> or root wrapper when Arabic active; avoid manual flipping of absolute positions where possible.
- Persistence Mechanism: Paraglide `setLocale` writes locale cookie; reuse existing behavior (cookie path `/`, locale code short form like `ar`, `zh-cn`).
- Formatting Scope: Explicitly excluded – no date/number/currency localization in this feature.

## Inventory Plan
1. Enumerate UI strings by scanning `web/src/routes` and `web/src/lib` components for literals in markup & aria-* attributes.
2. Tag each discovered string with proposed key; group by functional area.
3. Generate interim list for translation update (English unchanged; Arabic & Chinese require entries).
4. Identify potential duplicates (>1 identical English string) → unify under single key where semantics match.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Missed ARIA attribute | Accessibility regression | Add ARIA audit checklist; automated grep for `aria-` in Svelte components |
| RTL visual breakage | Poor UX for Arabic | Use logical properties; create Playwright visual assertions on key pages |
| Bundle size bloat | Performance budget risk | Measure pre/post gzip size; dedupe keys; consider lazy splitting if > +25KB |
| Untranslated new strings sneaking in | Incomplete localization | CI script compares key sets across locales |
| Over-translation of server data | Data inconsistency | Pattern: wrap only static labels; never pass dynamic values to translation keys |

## Alternatives Considered
- Separate namespace files per section: Rejected (adds complexity, no scaling need yet)
- Automatic extraction tooling now: Deferred (manual curation faster for current size)
- Introducing pluralization library: Rejected (out-of-scope per spec decision)

## Open Follow-Ups (Post-Feature)
- Add localized date/number formatting utility (future enhancement)
- Evaluate automated key extraction pipeline if messages exceed 800

- Logo alt text: "Spexity logo"

#### Authentication & Registration
- Loading states: "Redirecting..."
- Register form: "Profile", "Pick an alias", "Alias", "Your publicly visible name", "I am a human and I accept the", "terms and conditions", "Save"
- Error states: "Could not register"

#### Post Creation & Content
- Form labels: "Subject", "Body"
- Actions: "Create Post", "Start a Post"
- Validation: "Please write something", "Could not post"
- Terms compliance: "This post conforms to Spexity", "terms and conditions", "and this community guidelines."

#### Terms & Conditions Page
- Page title: "Terms and Conditions"
- Metadata: "Last updated: 22 September 2025"
- Introduction: "Please review these terms carefully. Using Spexity means you agree to the responsibilities and guidelines outlined here."
- Section divider: "Key Responsibilities"
- Section headers: "Eligibility", "User Content", "Changes to Terms"
- Content paragraphs (3 major blocks of legal text)

#### Accessibility Strings (ARIA)
- "Account menu button"
- "Account menu content"
- "Account profile"
- Alert role elements for error messages
- Editor component accessibility labels

**Provisional Key Count by Category:**
- Navigation/Layout: ~12 keys
- Authentication/Forms: ~15 keys
- Post Management: ~10 keys
- Terms & Conditions: ~15 keys
- Error/Status Messages: ~8 keys
- Accessibility-specific: ~5 keys

**Total Estimated Keys: ~65 distinct strings**

**Next Steps (T002-T004):**
- Generate formal key mapping in `web/messages/_key-map.json` ✅
- Create build validation script ✅
- Integrate into test pipeline ✅

**T022 Validation Results (2025-09-25):**
- **Key Count per Locale:** 44 keys each (en, ar, zh-cn)
- **Parity Status:** ✅ PASS - All locales have matching key sets
- **Missing Keys:** 0
- **Extra Keys:** 0
- **Translation Coverage:** 100%

## Accessibility Implementation Status

### T031 Final Accessibility Audit (2025-09-25)

**ARIA Implementation Review:**
✅ **Account Menu Accessibility**
- Account button: `aria-label={m.nav_account_button_aria()}` ✓
- Menu content: `aria-label={m.nav_account_menu_aria()}` ✓
- Profile link: `aria-label={m.nav_account_profile_aria()}` ✓

✅ **Form Error Handling**
- Error alerts use `role="alert"` for immediate announcement ✓
- Located in: register page, post form, community form ✓

✅ **Language Switch Live Region**
- Dedicated live region: `aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"` ✓
- Updates announced on locale change ✓
- Screen reader compatible ✓

✅ **Editor Accessibility**
- Dynamic `aria-labelledby` attribute for proper labeling ✓

**Key Coverage Validation:**
- ✅ All interactive controls have localized accessible names
- ✅ All error states use `role="alert"` with translated messages
- ✅ Language switching announces changes via live region
- ✅ Zero missing ARIA keys across all locales (44 keys each)

**RTL Layout Confirmation:**
- ✅ `dir="rtl"` set dynamically for Arabic locale
- ✅ CSS logical properties used throughout components
- ✅ Focus order remains logical in RTL mode

**Compliance Status:**
- ✅ Contract requirements from accessibility-contract.md met
- ✅ No mixed-language announcements detected
- ✅ Fallback handling implemented for development safety

**Final Grade: PASS** - All accessibility requirements implemented successfully.

## Summary
Research confirms feasibility within performance and accessibility budgets using existing tooling, with focus on complete key coverage, RTL robustness, and strict no-missing-keys CI enforcement. Implementation completed successfully with full accessibility compliance.
