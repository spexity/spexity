# Tech Choice

### Why Svelte?

- Compiled for performance and size
- As close to vanilla HTML, CSS and JS as possible
- Neater reactivity of components
- Something new for me to learn

### Why not React?

- Has grown old to be big and slow
- Too much ceremony around useSate, useMemo, useCallback
- Suspense system sucks balls
-
