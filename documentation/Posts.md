## The date/time

When the post's date and time are shown in the frontend, the user should be able to toggle between two modes:

1. Absolute date/time
2. Relative date/time (future)


## Absolute
Formatted to the user's locale.
If less than 18hrs ago, show the time.
If more than 18hrs ago, show the date and time.

## Relative (future)
